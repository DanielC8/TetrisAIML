    "### Frame the Problem\n",
    "The goal is to create an algorithm that can play the game “Tetris” for as long as possible.\n",
    "### Get the Data\n",
    "There is no data to retrieve and represent easily. \\\n",
    "Getting the data here will contain letting the population of models play the game and evaluating their performance at each stage. The model will take in the board state and the piece state and make a decision based on that.\n",
    "### Explore the Data\n",
    "The Tetris game is provided for us.\n",
    "* It consists of a board with a dimensions of 10 by 20.\n",
    "* Each turn of the game, the board generates a randomly selected piece and the player has to select a place to drop the piece.\n",
    "* The pieces consist of an l piece, o piece, L piece, J piece, z piece, s piece, and t piece. (7 in total).\n",
    "* The player is allowed to rotate the pieces 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.\n",
    "* Each turn, filled up rows are cleared.\n",
    "* The goal of this game is to last the longest. As a result, this consists of clearing the most lines, which we will use to measure how well the model does.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn’t a way to properly explore any data here, so instead let’s analyze the board and the properties. \\\n",
    "There’s 9 properties of interest: height sum, number of holes, bumpiness, number of pits, largest well size, number of columns with holes, row transitions, column transitions, and number of non empty rows. \\\n",
    "* Height Sum - Sum of the heights in each column\n",
    "* Number of holes - The number of empty cells on the board surrounded by blocks on top and bottom\n",
    "* Bumpiness - The difference of column heights between each adjacent column\n",
    "* Number of pits - Number of columns that are just all empty\n",
    "* Largest Well SIze - Largest difference between adjacent columns\n",
    "* Number of Columns with holes - Number of columns with gaps in the middle\n",
    "* Row Transitions - Counts the number of times adjacent cells change by row.\n",
    "* Column Transitions - Counts the number of times adjacent cells change by column\n",
    "* Number of nonempty rows - self-explanatory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The given code contains the game, board class, piece class, and several prewritten algorithms \\\n",
    "Models: \n",
    "* Genetic\n",
    "* Greedy\n",
    "* Monte Carlo\n",
    "* Random \n",
    "\n",
    "The way the model is supposed to perform is that at each step the game, the model is given the board state and the piece. The model mus then output the x value and piece orientation for the move. \n",
    "### Prepare the Data\n",
    "There is no real data preparation that can be done as there isn’t a set database. The data (board and piece states) is already prepared when given to the model. \n",
    "### Model the Data\n",
    "After some research, the best way of approaching this is using reinforcement learning or a genetic algorithm. After several long days of trying reinforcement learning, the model didn’t seem to want to improve after dropping 30 pieces. Despite tweaking the rewards function and making sure the code works as intended, I decided to cut my losses and move onto genetic. <br> \n",
    "The model provided below simply sets the gene (the weights for the 9 features stated above) and contains a “get_best_move” function to get the best move that the given gene states is the best. <br>\n",
    "### Fine Tune the Model\n",
    "To traini the model, we create a population of 100 models with random genes. Then, they play the game and the best 30 get to “reproduce” (combine randomly to form another genotype) and populate for a next iteration. This runs for a set amount of times and the best model is saved and how well it does is logged. The best of these runs will be saved and utilized for the final model.\n"
